We designed a new feature TACT COINS from which the users can view the list of tact coins that they gained by finishing their feature work . In this feature the admin can ADD and RELEASE the tact coins for the user through their repesctive login . There are two phases consists of this feature , first we want to integrate the feature , connecting with database and finally deploying the feature.


Nature Of Tact Coin

Tact Coins is similar to Google credits (or game credits) where volunteers can get the coins from the employers after finishing the requirements and the proper delivery.

User can convert those coins into real cash or gift cards every week.

```
“A spinning coin, still balanced on its rim, 
may fall in either direction.”
```

Value of Tact Coins
```
25 Tact Coins = ₹ 1
Tact Coins = 0.0008 $CAD
25 Tact Coins = 0.002 $CAD
```


**Stunning Innovation**

The main motto of this feature is to automate all the operations to be done by Admin Team . For this we made a login Interface for Users as well as the Admin and also session handler is used to monitor the operations . Finally we deployed this feature in Heroku.

```
“The only way to discover the limits of the possible 
is to go beyond them into the impossible”
```
